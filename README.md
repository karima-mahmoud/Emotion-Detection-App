# üß† Emotion Detection App (PyTorch + Gradio)

This project is an **Emotion Detection System** that uses NLP preprocessing and a deep learning model to classify English text into one of the six emotions:
**Joy, Sadness, Love, Anger, Fear, Surprise**.

Built with:
- **PyTorch** for training the neural network
- **Scikit-learn** for TF-IDF vectorization
- **Gradio** for building the interactive user interface

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is split into:
- `emotion_train.csv`
- `emotion_validation.csv`
- `emotion_test.csv`

Each file contains:
- `text`: the input sentence
- `label`: the emotion label (encoded as integers)

## üßπ Preprocessing Steps

Text data undergoes the following steps:
1. Remove usernames (`@user`)
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Convert emojis to text using `emoji.demojize`
4. Remove punctuation
5. Remove stopwords
6. Lemmatization using POS tagging
7. Remove numbers and single characters
8. Remove unwanted words (e.g. "lol", "gonna", etc.)

## üß† Model Architecture

The neural network has the following layers:

- `Linear(input_size ‚Üí 256)`
- `BatchNorm1d`
- `Dropout(0.5)`
- `Linear(256 ‚Üí 128)`
- `BatchNorm1d`
- `Dropout(0.3)`
- `Linear(128 ‚Üí 6)` ‚Üí Final output logits

Trained using:
- CrossEntropyLoss
- Adam optimizer
- TF-IDF vectorized inputs

---

## üìà Training & Evaluation

Training is performed over 15 epochs and validated on a separate set. The best model (with highest validation accuracy) is saved as `best_model.pth`.

Performance is visualized using matplotlib for:
- Loss per epoch
- Accuracy per epoch

## üñ•Ô∏è Gradio Interface

The app includes a web interface using **Gradio**:

```bash
# Run the app locally
python app.py
